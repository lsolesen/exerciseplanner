= EXERCISE PLANNER =

== IDEA ==

=== VERSION 0.1 ===

The site should have a lot of exercises. The exercises has both pictures, description, and videoes (probably
through for instance vimeo). You can relate exercises to each other, tag them, and from the tagging it should be able 
to automatically find out which are related.

One can login to the site as either:

1) A coach

- The coach can create standard programs
- The coach can have more players and create programs for the player (e.g. by transerring the standard program)
- The coach can create own exercises, which can be submitted for admission to the general database

2) A player

- The player can create programs for himself and see the programs the trainer has created.
- The player can create own exercises, which can be submitted for admission to the general database (or maybe just for the coach)

=== VERSION 1.0 ====

- The site provides articles
- The player can follow the training through a log - which is connected to one's training program
- The exercises references muscle groups, so it is easy to choose

=== VERSION 2.0 ===

- You should be able to use the program with other sports, so you can create for instance a soccer program as a coach
- You can plan an entire season using the program, so the single programs are connected to a calendar
